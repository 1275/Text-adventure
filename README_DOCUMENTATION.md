# Documentation Index - Learning C from a C++ Background

Welcome! This project now has extensive documentation to help you understand C. Start here!

## 📚 Documentation Files

### 1. **C_VS_CPP_GUIDE.md** ⭐ START HERE
The essential reference comparing C and C++. Read this first to understand the fundamental differences.

**Topics covered:**
- Classes vs Structs
- Pointers vs References  
- Memory management (stack vs heap)
- No STL - arrays and manual string handling
- Input/output differences
- Common gotchas for C++ developers

**Time to read:** 15-20 minutes

---

### 2. **C_EXAMPLES.md** ⭐ READ SECOND
Practical, hands-on examples showing exactly how the patterns in main.c work.

**Topics covered:**
- scanf and getchar explained
- Pointer mechanics with real examples
- Struct access (. vs ->)
- Array and pointer relationship
- Game loop pattern
- Error handling without exceptions
- Printf format specifiers

**Time to read:** 20-30 minutes

---

### 3. **main.c** ⭐ READ THIRD (Fully Documented)
The actual source code with extensive inline comments explaining every line.

**What you'll learn:**
- How the game loop works
- Character class selection implementation
- Input validation in C
- Stack allocation and automatic cleanup
- Real-world C patterns in action

**Time to read:** 30-40 minutes (study carefully!)

---

### 4. **ADDING_CLASSES.md**
Quick guide showing how easy it is to add new character classes now.

**Useful for:**
- Understanding the refactored class system
- Seeing how data-driven design works in C
- Learning to extend the codebase

**Time to read:** 5 minutes

## 🎯 Suggested Learning Path

### Day 1: Foundations
1. Read **C_VS_CPP_GUIDE.md** completely
2. Read **C_EXAMPLES.md** sections 1-5
3. Skim through **main.c** to see the structure

### Day 2: Deep Dive
1. Read **main.c** carefully with the guide open
2. Read **C_EXAMPLES.md** sections 6-10
3. Try adding a printf statement to main.c and recompile

### Day 3: Practice
1. Read **ADDING_CLASSES.md**
2. Try adding a new character class (like Rogue)
3. Look at player.h and player.c to see how structs work

### Day 4: Exploration
1. Read through the other .h files (dungeon.h, ui.h, etc.)
2. Trace through a function call from main to understand the flow
3. Experiment with modifying game values

## 🔑 Key Concepts to Master

### Critical Concepts (Must Understand)
- [ ] Pointers and addresses (&, *)
- [ ] Structs (typedef, member access)
- [ ] Arrays and strings (char[])
- [ ] Function signatures (return types, parameters)
- [ ] Stack vs heap allocation

### Important Concepts (Should Understand)
- [ ] Pass-by-pointer pattern
- [ ] Return values for error handling
- [ ] Printf format specifiers
- [ ] Header files and includes
- [ ] Initialization syntax

### Nice to Know (Can Learn Later)
- [ ] Pointer arithmetic
- [ ] Function pointers
- [ ] Bitwise operations
- [ ] Union types
- [ ] Volatile and const qualifiers

## 🚀 Quick Reference Card

### Variable Declaration
```c
int x = 10;                    // Integer
float y = 3.14;                // Float
char c = 'A';                  // Character
char str[50] = "Hello";        // String (array)
Player p = {100, 1};           // Struct initialization
Player *ptr = &p;              // Pointer to struct
```

### Functions
```c
// Declaration (in .h file)
void player_init(Player *p, PlayerClass class);

// Definition (in .c file)
void player_init(Player *p, PlayerClass class) {
    p->health = 100;
}

// Usage
Player player;
player_init(&player, CLASS_WARRIOR);
```

### Control Flow
```c
if (condition) { }
while (condition) { }
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) { }
switch (value) {
    case 1: break;
    default: break;
}
```

### Input/Output
```c
printf("Value: %d\n", x);      // Print
scanf("%d", &x);               // Read (note the &)
char c = getchar();            // Read one char
```

## 💡 Common Questions

### Q: Why so many pointers?
**A:** C doesn't have references. Pointers are the only way to modify variables in other functions or avoid copying large structs.

### Q: Why no string type?
**A:** C predates modern programming. Strings are just arrays of chars ending in '\0'. Simple but requires care.

### Q: Why manual initialization?
**A:** No constructors in C. Structs are just memory - you must explicitly set values.

### Q: How do I know when to use & or *?
**A:** 
- Use `&` to get an address: `&variable`
- Use `*` to declare a pointer: `int *ptr`
- Use `*` to dereference: `*ptr = 5`
- Use `->` to access through pointer: `ptr->member`

### Q: What if I make a mistake?
**A:** C won't always tell you! Common issues:
- Buffer overflow → undefined behavior (might crash, might not)
- Use after free → undefined behavior
- NULL pointer dereference → usually crashes
- Missing '\0' in string → reads garbage memory

**Solution:** Be careful, check bounds, validate inputs, test thoroughly!
